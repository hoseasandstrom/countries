Create a Country class to store both the name and abbreviation.

Read and parse the "countries.txt" file into an HashMap<String, ArrayList<Country>> where the key is a single letter and the value is a list of countries whose names start with that letter.

Ask the user to type a letter (if they don't type a single letter, throw an exception).

Save an "X_countries.txt" file, where X is the letter they typed, which only lists the countries starting with that letter.

Optional tasks

Break your code into separate methods, especially the for loop that loops over each line in the file, and the code under it that reads the user's input and writes the file.

Write tests for your methods where it makes sense to.

Encode the output as JSON instead of building a string manually. You should be able to take the ArrayList you pulled out of your HashMap and directly pass it to the serialize method. Remember to add getters to your Country class.

Override the toString method in your Country class so when you print your HashMap you can see the country abbreviations and names. Recall that, by default, Java prints out objects liket his: Country@21345362.
